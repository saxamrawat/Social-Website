                    <p>An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in
                        the near future,
                        either
                        worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction. Endangered species may be at risk due to
                        factors such as habitat loss, poaching and invasive species. The International Union for
                        Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List lists the global conservation status of many species, and
                        various other agencies assess the status of species within particular areas. Many nations have
                        laws that protect conservation-reliant species which, for example, forbid hunting, restrict land
                        development, or create protected areas. Some endangered species are the target of extensive
                        conservation efforts such as captive breeding and habitat restoration.

                        Human activity is a significant cause in causing some species to become endangered.</p>

                                        <p>A loss of habitat can happen naturally. Dinosaurs, for instance, lost their
                                            habitat about 65 million years ago. The hot, dry climate of the Cretaceous
                                            period changed very quickly, most likely because of an asteroid striking the
                                            Earth. The impact of the asteroid forced debris into the atmosphere,
                                            reducing the amount of heat and light that reached Earth’s surface. The
                                            dinosaurs were unable to adapt to this new, cooler habitat. Dinosaurs became
                                            endangered, then extinct.</p>

                                        <p>Human activity can also contribute to a loss of habitat. Development for
                                            housing, industry, and agriculture reduces the habitat of native organisms.
                                            This can happen in a number of different ways.</p>

                                        <p>Development can eliminate habitat and native species directly. In the Amazon
                                            rain forest of South America, developers have cleared hundreds of thousands
                                            of acres. To “clear” a piece of land is to remove all trees and vegetation
                                            from it. The Amazon rain forest is cleared for cattle ranches, logging, and
                                            urban use.</p>

                                        <p>Development can also endanger species indirectly. Some species, such as fig
                                            trees of the rain forest, may provide habitat for other species. As trees
                                            are destroyed, species that depend on that tree habitat may also become
                                            endangered. Tree crowns provide habitat in the canopy, or top layer, of a
                                            rainforest. Plants such as vines, fungi such as mushrooms, and insects such
                                            as butterflies live in the rain forest canopy. So do hundreds of species of
                                            tropical birds and mammals such as monkeys. As trees are cut down, this
                                            habitat is lost. Species have less room to live and reproduce.</p>

                                        <p>Loss of habitat may happen as development takes place in a species range.
                                            Many animals have a range of hundreds of square kilometers. The mountain
                                            lion of North America, for instance, has a range of up to 1,000 square
                                            kilometers (386 square miles). To successfully live and reproduce, a single
                                            mountain lion patrols this much territory. Urban areas, such as Los Angeles,
                                            California, and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, grew rapidly during the
                                            20th century. As these areas expanded into the wilderness, the mountain
                                            lion’s habitat became smaller. That means the habitat can support fewer
                                            mountain lions. Because enormous parts of the Sierra Nevada, Rocky, and
                                            Cascade mountain ranges remain undeveloped, however, mountain lions are not
                                            endangered.</p>

                                        <p>Loss of habitat can also lead to increased encounters between wild species
                                            and people. As development brings people deeper into a species range, they
                                            may have more exposure to wild species. Poisonous plants and fungi may grow
                                            closer to homes and schools. Wild animals are also spotted more frequently.
                                            These animals are simply patrolling their range, but interaction with people
                                            can be deadly. Polar bears, mountain lions, and alligators are all predators
                                            brought into close contact with people as they lose their habitat to homes,
                                            farms, and businesses. As people kill these wild animals, through
                                            pesticides, accidents such as collisions with cars, or hunting, native
                                            species may become endangered.</p>

                                        <p>Genetic variation is the diversity found within a species. It’s why human
                                            beings may have blond, red, brown, or black hair. Genetic variation allows
                                            species to adapt to changes in the environment. Usually, the greater the
                                            population of a species, the greater its genetic variation.</p>

                                        <p>Inbreeding is reproduction with close family members. Groups of species that
                                            have a tendency to inbreed usually have little genetic variation, because no
                                            new genetic information is introduced to the group. Disease is much more
                                            common, and much more deadly, among inbred groups. Inbred species do not
                                            have the genetic variation to develop resistance to the disease. For this
                                            reason, fewer offspring of inbred groups survive to maturity.</p>

                                        <p>Loss of genetic variation can occur naturally. Cheetahs are a threatened
                                            species native to Africa and Asia. These big cats have very little genetic
                                            variation. Biologists say that during the last ice age, cheetahs went
                                            through a long period of inbreeding. As a result, there are very few genetic
                                            differences between cheetahs. They cannot adapt to changes in the
                                            environment as quickly as other animals, and fewer cheetahs survive to
                                            maturity. Cheetahs are also much more difficult to breed in captivity than
                                            other big cats, such as lions.</p>

                                        <p>Human activity can also lead to a loss of genetic variation. Overhunting and
                                            overfishing have reduced the populations of many animals. Reduced population
                                            means there are fewer breeding pairs. A breeding pair is made up of two
                                            mature members of the species that are not closely related and can produce
                                            healthy offspring. With fewer breeding pairs, genetic variation shrinks.</p>

                                        <p>Monoculture, the agricultural method of growing a single crop, can also
                                            reduce genetic variation. Modern agribusiness relies on monocultures. Almost
                                            all potatoes cultivated, sold, and consumed, for instance, are from a single
                                            species, the Russet Burbank. Potatoes, native to the Andes Mountains of
                                            South America, have dozens of natural varieties. The genetic variation of
                                            wild potatoes allows them to adapt to climate change and disease. For Russet
                                            Burbanks, however, farmers must use fertilizers and pesticides to ensure
                                            healthy crops because the plant has almost no genetic variation.</p>

                                        <p>Plant breeders often go back to wild varieties to collect genes that will
                                            help cultivated plants resist pests and drought, and adapt to climate
                                            change. However, climate change is also threatening wild varieties. That
                                            means domesticated plants may lose an important source of traits that help
                                            them overcome new threats.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) keeps a “Red List of Threatened
                            Species.” The Red List defines the severity and specific causes of a species’ threat of
                            extinction. The Red List has seven levels of conservation: least concern, near threatened,
                            vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered, extinct in the wild, and extinct. Each
                            category represents a different threat level.</p>

                        <p>Species that are not threatened by extinction are placed within the first two
                            categories—least concern and near-threatened. Those that are most threatened are placed
                            within the next three categories, known as the threatened categories—vulnerable, endangered,
                            and critically endangered. Those species that are extinct in some form are placed within the
                            last two categories—extinct in the wild and extinct.</p>

                        <p>Classifying a species as endangered has to do with its range and habitat, as well as its
                            actual population. For this reason, a species can be of least concern in one area and
                            endangered in another. The gray whale, for instance, has a healthy population in the eastern
                            Pacific Ocean, along the coast of North and South America. The population in the western
                            Pacific, however, is critically endangered.</p>

                                <p>The definitions of the three threatened categories (vulnerable, endangered, and critically
                                    endangered) are based on five criteria: population reduction rate, geographic range,
                                    population size, population restrictions, and probability of extinction.</p>
        
                                <p>Threatened categories have different thresholds for these criteria. As the population and
                                    range of the species decreases, the species becomes more threatened.</p>
        
                                <p>1) Population reduction rate:
                                    A species is classified as vulnerable if its population has declined between 30 and 50
                                    percent. This decline is measured over 10 years or three generations of the species,
                                    whichever is longer. A generation is the period of time between the birth of an animal and
                                    the time it is able to reproduce. Mice are able to reproduce when they are about one month
                                    old. Mouse populations are mostly tracked over 10-year periods. An elephant's generation
                                    lasts about 15 years. So, elephant populations are measured over 45-year periods.</p>
                                <p> A species is vulnerable if its population has declined at least 50 percent and the cause of
                                    the decline is known. Habitat loss is the leading known cause of population decline.</p>
                                <p>A species is also classified as vulnerable if its population has declined at least 30
                                    percent and the cause of the decline is not known. A new, unknown virus, for example, could
                                    kill hundreds or even thousands of individuals before being identified.</p>
                                <p>2) Geographic range:
                                    A species is vulnerable if its “extent of occurrence” is estimated to be less than 20,000
                                    square kilometers (7,722 square miles). An extent of occurrence is the smallest area that
                                    could contain all sites of a species’ population. If all members of a species could survive
                                    in a single area, the size of that area is the species’ extent of occurrence.</p>
                                <p> A species is also classified as vulnerable if its “area of occupancy” is estimated to be
                                    less than 2,000 square kilometers (772 square miles). An area of occupancy is where a
                                    specific population of that species resides. This area is often a breeding or nesting site
                                    in a species range.</p>
                                <p>3) Population size:
                                    Species with fewer than 10,000 mature individuals are vulnerable. The species is also
                                    vulnerable if that population declines by at least 10 percent within 10 years or three
                                    generations, whichever is longer.</p>
                                <p>4) Population restrictions:
                                    Population restriction is a combination of population and area of occupancy. A species is
                                    vulnerable if it is restricted to less than 1,000 mature individuals or an area of occupancy
                                    of less than 20 square kilometers (8 square miles).</p>
                                <p>5) Probability of extinction in the wild is at least 10 percent within 100 years.
                                    Biologists, anthropologists, meteorologists, and other scientists have developed complex
                                    ways to determine a species’ probability of extinction. These formulas calculate the chances
                                    a species can survive, without human protection, in the wild.</p>
                                <p>Vulnerable Species: Ethiopian Banana Frog
                                    The Ethiopian banana frog (Afrixalus enseticola) is a small frog native to high-altitude
                                    areas of southern Ethiopia. It is a vulnerable species because its area of occupancy is less
                                    than 2,000 square kilometers (772 square miles). The extent and quality of its forest
                                    habitat are in decline. Threats to this habitat include forest clearance, mostly for housing
                                    and agriculture.</p>
                                <p> Vulnerable Species: Snaggletooth Shark
                                    The snaggletooth shark (Hemipristis elongatus) is found in the tropical, coastal waters of
                                    the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Its area of occupancy is enormous, from southeast Africa to
                                    the Philippines, and from China to Australia.</p>
                                <p>However, the snaggletooth shark is a vulnerable species because of a severe population
                                    reduction rate. Its population has fallen more than 10 percent over 10 years. The number of
                                    sharks is declining due to fisheries, especially in the Java Sea and Gulf of Thailand. The
                                    snaggletooth shark’s flesh, fins, and liver are considered high-quality foods. They are sold
                                    in commercial fish markets, as well as restaurants.</p>
                                <p>Vulnerable Species: Galapagos Kelp
                                    Galapagos kelp (Eisenia galapagensis) is a type of seaweed only found near the Galapagos
                                    Islands in the Pacific Ocean. Galapagos kelp is classified as vulnerable because its
                                    population has declined more than 10 percent over 10 years.</p>
                                <p>Climate change is the leading cause of decline among Galapagos kelp. El Nino, the natural
                                    weather pattern that brings unusually warm water to the Galapagos, is the leading agent of
                                    climate change in this area. Galapagos kelp is a cold-water species and does not adapt
                                    quickly to changes in water temperature.</p>

                                <p>Endangered Species: Siberian Sturgeon
                                    The Siberian sturgeon (Acipenser baerii) is a large fish found in rivers and lakes
                                    throughout
                                    the Siberian region of Russia. The Siberian sturgeon is a benthic species. Benthic species
                                    live
                                    at the bottom of a body of water.</p>
        
                                <p>The Siberian sturgeon is an endangered species because its total population has declined
                                    between
                                    50 and 80 percent during the past 60 years (three generations of sturgeon). Overfishing,
                                    poaching, and dam construction have caused this decline. Pollution from mining activities
                                    has
                                    also contributed to abnormalities in the sturgeon’s reproductive system.</p>
        
                                <p>Endangered Species: Tahiti Reed-warbler
                                    The Tahiti reed-warbler (Acrocephalus caffer) is a songbird found on the Pacific island of
                                    Tahiti. It is an endangered species because it has a very small population. The bird is only
                                    found on a single island, meaning both its extent of occurrence and area of occupancy are
                                    very
                                    small.</p>
        
                                <p>The Tahiti reed-warbler is also endangered because of human activity. The tropical weed
                                    Miconia
                                    is a non-native species that has taken over much of Tahiti’s native vegetation. The
                                    reed-warbler
                                    lives almost exclusively in Tahiti’s bamboo forests. The bird nests in bamboo and feeds on
                                    flowers and insects that live there. As development and invasive species such as Miconia
                                    destroy
                                    the bamboo forests, the population of Tahiti reed-warblers continues to shrink.</p>
        
                                <p>Endangered Species: Ebony
                                    Ebony (Diospyros crassiflora) is a tree native to the rain forests of central Africa,
                                    including
                                    Congo, Cameroon, and Gabon. Ebony is an endangered species because many biologists calculate
                                    its
                                    probability of extinction in the wild is at least 20 percent within five generations.</p>
        
                                <p>Ebony is threatened due to overharvesting. Ebony trees produce a very heavy, dark wood. When
                                    polished, ebony can be mistaken for black marble or other stone. For centuries, ebony trees
                                    have
                                    been harvested for furniture and sculptural uses such as chess pieces. Most ebony, however,
                                    is
                                    harvested to make musical instruments such as piano keys and the fingerboards of stringed
                                    instruments.</p>

                                  <p>Critically Endangered Species: White Ferula Mushroom
                                      The white ferula mushroom (Pleurotus nebrodensis) is a critically endangered species of
                                      fungus. The mushroom is critically endangered because its extent of occurrence is less than
                                      100 square kilometers (39 square miles). It is only found in the northern part of the
                                      Italian island of Sicily, in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
                                  <p>The leading threats to white ferula mushrooms are loss of habitat and overharvesting. White
                                      ferula mushrooms are a gourmet food item. Farmers and amateur mushroom hunters harvest the
                                      fungus for food and profit. The mushrooms can be sold for up to $100 per kilogram (2.2
                                      pounds).</p>

                                  <p>Extinct: Cuban Macaw
                                      The Cuban macaw (Ara tricolor) was a tropical parrot native to Cuba and a small Cuban
                                      island, Isla de la Juventud. Hunting and collecting the birds for pets led to the bird’s
                                      extinction. The last specimen of the Cuban macaw was collected in 1864.</p>
                                  <p>Extinct: Ridley’s Stick Insect
                                      Ridley’s stick insect (Pseudobactricia ridleyi) was native to the tropical jungle of the
                                      island of Singapore. This insect, whose long, segmented body resembled a tree limb, is only
                                      known through a single specimen, collected more than 100 years ago. During the 20th century,
                                      Singapore experienced rapid development. Almost the entire jungle was cleared, depriving the
                                      insect of its habitat.</p>
                                  <p>Extinct: Sri Lankan Legume Tree
                                      The Sri Lankan legume tree (Crudia zeylanica), native only to the island of Sri Lanka in the
                                      Indian Ocean, was a giant species of legume. Peas and peanuts are smaller types of legumes.

                                  <p>Habitat loss from development in the 20th century is the main reason the tree went extinct in
                                      the wild. A single specimen survived at the Royal Botanical Garden in Peradeniya, Sri Lanka,
                                      until 1990, when that, too, was lost.</p>
