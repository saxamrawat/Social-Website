                    <h2>What is an "Endangered Species"?</h2>
                    <p>An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future,
                        either
                        worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction. Endangered species may be at risk due to
                        factors such as habitat loss, poaching and invasive species. The International Union for
                        Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List lists the global conservation status of many species, and
                        various other agencies assess the status of species within particular areas. Many nations have
                        laws that protect conservation-reliant species which, for example, forbid hunting, restrict land
                        development, or create protected areas. Some endangered species are the target of extensive
                        conservation efforts such as captive breeding and habitat restoration.

                        Human activity is a significant cause in causing some species to become endangered.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Why does a species become endangered"?</h2>
                    <p>Species become endangered for two main reasons: loss of habitat and loss of genetic variation.
                    <h3>Loss of Habitat</h3>
                    <p>
                        A loss of habitat can happen naturally. Dinosaurs, for instance, lost their habitat about 65
                        million years ago. The hot, dry climate of the Cretaceous period changed very quickly, most
                        likely because of an asteroid striking the Earth. The impact of the asteroid forced debris into
                        the atmosphere, reducing the amount of heat and light that reached Earth’s surface. The
                        dinosaurs were unable to adapt to this new, cooler habitat. Dinosaurs became endangered, then
                        extinct. <br>

                        Human activity can also contribute to a loss of habitat. Development for housing, industry, and
                        agriculture reduces the habitat of native organisms. This can happen in a number of different
                        ways. <br>

                        Development can eliminate habitat and native species directly. In the Amazon rain forest of
                        South America, developers have cleared hundreds of thousands of acres. To “clear” a piece of
                        land is to remove all trees and vegetation from it. The Amazon rain forest is cleared for cattle
                        ranches, logging, and urban use. <br>

                        Development can also endanger species indirectly. Some species, such as fig trees of the rain
                        forest, may provide habitat for other species. As trees are destroyed, species that depend on
                        that tree habitat may also become endangered. Tree crowns provide habitat in the canopy, or top
                        layer, of a rainforest. Plants such as vines, fungi such as mushrooms, and insects such as
                        butterflies live in the rain forest canopy. So do hundreds of species of tropical birds and
                        mammals such as monkeys. As trees are cut down, this habitat is lost. Species have less room to
                        live and reproduce. <br>

                        Loss of habitat may happen as development takes place in a species range. Many animals have a
                        range of hundreds of square kilometers. The mountain lion of North America, for instance, has a
                        range of up to 1,000 square kilometers (386 square miles). To successfully live and reproduce, a
                        single mountain lion patrols this much territory. Urban areas, such as Los Angeles, California,
                        and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, grew rapidly during the 20th century. As these areas
                        expanded into the wilderness, the mountain lion’s habitat became smaller. That means the habitat
                        can support fewer mountain lions. Because enormous parts of the Sierra Nevada, Rocky, and
                        Cascade mountain ranges remain undeveloped, however, mountain lions are not endangered. <br>

                        Loss of habitat can also lead to increased encounters between wild species and people. As
                        development brings people deeper into a species range, they may have more exposure to wild
                        species. Poisonous plants and fungi may grow closer to homes and schools. Wild animals are also
                        spotted more frequently. These animals are simply patrolling their range, but interaction with
                        people can be deadly. Polar bears, mountain lions, and alligators are all predators brought into
                        close contact with people as they lose their habitat to homes, farms, and businesses. As people
                        kill these wild animals, through pesticides, accidents such as collisions with cars, or hunting,
                        native species may become endangered.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Loss of Genetic Variation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Genetic variation is the diversity found within a species. It’s why human beings may have blond,
                        red, brown, or black hair. Genetic variation allows species to adapt to changes in the
                        environment. Usually, the greater the population of a species, the greater its genetic
                        variation. <br>

                        Inbreeding is reproduction with close family members. Groups of species that have a tendency to
                        inbreed usually have little genetic variation, because no new genetic information is introduced
                        to the group. Disease is much more common, and much more deadly, among inbred groups. Inbred
                        species do not have the genetic variation to develop resistance to the disease. For this reason,
                        fewer offspring of inbred groups survive to maturity. <br>

                        Loss of genetic variation can occur naturally. Cheetahs are a threatened species native to
                        Africa and Asia. These big cats have very little genetic variation. Biologists say that during
                        the last ice age, cheetahs went through a long period of inbreeding. As a result, there are very
                        few genetic differences between cheetahs. They cannot adapt to changes in the environment as
                        quickly as other animals, and fewer cheetahs survive to maturity. Cheetahs are also much more
                        difficult to breed in captivity than other big cats, such as lions. <br>

                        Human activity can also lead to a loss of genetic variation. Overhunting and overfishing have
                        reduced the populations of many animals. Reduced population means there are fewer breeding
                        pairs. A breeding pair is made up of two mature members of the species that are not closely
                        related and can produce healthy offspring. With fewer breeding pairs, genetic variation shrinks. <br>

                        Monoculture, the agricultural method of growing a single crop, can also reduce genetic
                        variation. Modern agribusiness relies on monocultures. Almost all potatoes cultivated, sold, and
                        consumed, for instance, are from a single species, the Russet Burbank. Potatoes, native to the
                        Andes Mountains of South America, have dozens of natural varieties. The genetic variation of
                        wild potatoes allows them to adapt to climate change and disease. For Russet Burbanks, however,
                        farmers must use fertilizers and pesticides to ensure healthy crops because the plant has almost
                        no genetic variation. <br>

                        Plant breeders often go back to wild varieties to collect genes that will help cultivated plants
                        resist pests and drought, and adapt to climate change. However, climate change is also
                        threatening wild varieties. That means domesticated plants may lose an important source of
                        traits that help them overcome new threats.
